# BoggleSolver

Type in the board dimension(s), and the letters; BoggleSolver generates all the possible words up to a maximum specified size which you can write down to score the maximum number of points.

Example, if your Boggle game board looked like this:
THA
ULY
REN

You would input:

3
THAULYREN
